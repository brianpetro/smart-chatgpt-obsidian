- Supports multiple threads per codeblock.

### Dataview Integration


````md
# in progress
```dataview
LIST WITHOUT ID file.folder + " " + file.link + " " + file.mday 
WHERE chat-active!=null
SORT file.mtime DESC
```
````

````md
# completed
```dataview
LIST choice(typeof(chat-done)="string", 1, length(chat-done))
WHERE chat-done
SORT choice(typeof(chat-done)="string", 1, length(chat-done)) DESC
```
````

- Dataviews dynamically update as thread statuses change.
